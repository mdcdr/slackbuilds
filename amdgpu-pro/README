AMDGPU-Pro Driver

Kernel modules build mode can be specified with BUILDMOD:
BUILDMOD=1 ./amdgpu-pro.SlackBuild

BUILDMOD valuea are:
0 - do not build kernel module
1 - build kernel module at package creation and put it in package
2 - build kernel module at package installation (default)

You can also run /opt/amdgpu-pro/bin/build_kernel_mod.sh to build kernel module later if kernel is upgraded.

After you compile and install kernel module, reboot is required or unloading of default kernel module amdgpu.

You can also set REPLACELIBS=yes,
if you want to replace system libraries from mesa and libdrm with AMD ones.
Backup is made and you can later restore it with:
/opt/amdgpu-pro/bin/restorelibs.sh
