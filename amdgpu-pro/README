AMDGPU-Pro Driver

Kernel modules build mode can be specified with BUILDMOD:
BUILDMOD=1 ./amdgpu-pro.SlackBuild

BUILDMOD valuea are:
0 - do not build kernel module
1 - build kernel module at package creation and put it in package (default)
2 - build kernel module at package installation

You can also run /opt/amdgpu-pro/bin/build_kernel_mod.sh to build kernel module later if kernel is upgraded.

After you compile and install kernel module, reboot is required or unloading of default kernel module amdgpu.

If you want to compile for another kernel version set KERNELSRC to kernel source directory, for ex.:
KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux-4.10-rc5

You can also set REPLACELIBS=yes,
if you want to replace system libraries from mesa and libdrm with AMD ones.
Backup is made and you can later restore it with:
/opt/amdgpu-pro/bin/restorelibs.sh

32bit support (on 64bit arch) can be enabled with:
INSTALL32BIT=yes
or disabled:
INSTALL32BIT=no
default is auto detect.
